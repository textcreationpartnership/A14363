            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>So be it. Nowe wyll I declare vnto you, what it is that my conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is ſo ſore encombred withal. When I do conſider wyth my ſelfe, how that the couenaunt of life &amp; word of ſaluation is not preached vnto all natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and peoples in like: and again wher it is preached, that ſkarcelye the tenth part of them that it is offred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, do embrace and receiue it: I am eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at my wittes ende, and canne not tell what I ſhuld ſay to it. For, it is wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,<note place="margin">i. Tim. ii.</note> that God will haue all men to be ſaued, and to come to the knowledge of hys truthe. If he will haue all men to be ſaued, and to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his truth, whye dothe he not ſende his Prophets and meſſengers vnto all menne in like? We read that the ſprite of God did forbid Paul and Silas to preach the word in Aſia,<note place="margin">Act. xvi.</note> and that when they ſought to go into Bi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thynia, he wold in no wiſe ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                     <pb facs="tcp:177821:11"/> compariſon of thoſe that dyd reiecte, contemne and deſpiſe it. I haue heard you ſay, and I know that it is wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the goſpel of our ſauiour Ieſu Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iohn. vi.</note> that none come vnto the truth except our heauenly father doth draw them. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he him ſelf did make that moſt wholeſome and comfortable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of the ſpiritual eating and dryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his fleſh and bloud,<note place="margin">Iohn. vi.</note> they went all away from him, the twelf only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, then did he ſay: No manne can come vnto me, except it be geuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him of my father. Whereby I doe learne that they whiche receiue the truth, when it is preached and offered vnto them, doe it onlye throughe the grace and gift of almightye God oure heauenly father, and not of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues. Why is not then this gyft geuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to al men in lyke. Shall we ſaye that god is a partial god, and an acceptour of perſons? But the holy ſcryptures doo teſtifye vnto vs that there is no parcialiatye in him. Syth then that all men generallye of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are the children of wrathe and

And thoughe it were ſo, that we ſhuld graunt, that Adam did fal by the deuine Predeſtination &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denance of almighty god, yet could

For, as it hath bene ſaid alreadye,<note place="margin">Ephe. i.</note> God hathe choſen vs in Chriſt Ieſu afore that the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of the world were layde, that we ſhoulde be holye and wythoute blame before him, throughe loue.</p>
                  <p>And hath ordained vs before, throu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ghe Ieſu Chriſte to be heyres vnto him ſelf, according to the pleaſure of his wil, to the praiſe of the glory of his grace, wherewith he hathe made vs accepted in the beloued.</p>

For, Ihon the Apoſtle ſaith: He that hath the ſon, hathe life, but he that hathe not the ſonne of God, hathe not lyfe. And wyth it dothe the Goſpell agree.</p>
                  <p>For, there our ſauior Ieſus Chriſt ſaithe: Thys is the wyll of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that hath ſent me,<note place="margin">Iohn. vi.</note> that who ſo euer doth ſe the ſonne and beleueth in him, hath life euerlaſting, and I ſhal raiſe him vp in the laſte daye.

<pb facs="tcp:177821:44"/> that we ſhuld be ſaued in his ſonne through faith. On the contrari, the Lord ſpeaking of them that be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated vnto death euerlaſtyng, and vnto condemnation, he ſaythe: he that beleueth not is already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned,<note place="margin">Ihon. iii.</note> becauſe that he dyd not beleue in the name of the onlye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſonne of God. And this is the condemnation, that the lyghte did come into the worlde, and men did loue darckneſſe more than the light. Therfore, if any man ſhould aſke me nowe, whether he be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to life, or ordained vnto death, that is to ſaye, whether he be of the nomber of the choſen, or of the nomber of the reprobate? I would anſwer him plainlye out of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelicall and Apoſtolicall ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that if he hathe fellowſhyppe with Chriſte, he is ordained vnto life, and is of the noumber of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and choſen, if not: that he is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained vnto death and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For, ſurely all they that haue

                  <p>Thys doubtleſſe is a mere cauillation.<note place="margin">Enchery. ad Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentium Ca. xxxi.</note> Howbe it I haue lieuer to confute it with the words of S. Auguſtine, than with myne owne. If (ſaith he) the Apoſtle dyd meane none other thinge, but that it doth not only lie in the wyll and renuing of man, except the mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lord doth healpe, we may alſo ſaye on the contrarye, that it lyeth not only in the mercy of God, with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out the wil and renuing of manne. But ſith that it wer a plain vngod<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lineſſe to ſaye ſo, let vs not doubte but that the apoſtle did attribute al thinges vnto the mercy of God, and that he did leaue no maner of thing vnto our owne will and endeuors. And in an other place theſe be hys
<pb facs="tcp:177821:46"/> woordes. <hi>Quapropter vt in deum creda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, &amp; pie vmamus,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>That is ſaye: therefore, that we ſhould beleue in God, and liue god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it lieth not in the wil or renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of manne, but in the mercy of God: not that we oughte not bothe to will and to renue, but becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he him ſelf doth worke in vs, bothe to wil and alſo to renue. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge then of the Apoſtle was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that he did ſe, that ſome men did attribute parte of their ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vnto their own induſtry, for to reproue theyr errour in the former parte of the ſentence, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes to adſcribe the hole matter of ſaluation vnto the only mercye of God. Do not the Prophets (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeche you) generalli in al places ſet forthe earneſtlye the free callynge of God? The Prophet dothe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlye declare,<note place="margin">Eſay. lxv.</note> whome the Lorde
<pb facs="tcp:177821:47"/> dothe offer his woorde to, when he ſaith: I am found of them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſought me not, and haue plainli appeared vnto them, that dyd not aſke of me. Vnto the people that dyd not call vppon my name, haue I ſaide: Lo, here I am.<note place="margin">Ioſ. xxiiii</note> And leaſte the Iewes ſhuld thinke that this kindnes and mercy dyd onlye pertayne vnto the gentils, he doth put them in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, whence he did take their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abraham, when he made hys couenaunt with him.<note place="margin">The ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght of god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des word is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient prof of his fre goodneſſe and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci toward vs.</note> Euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mydſt of Idolatry, wherin he was ouerwhelmed wyth al hys. When the lord the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth offer vnto vs firſt, the lyght of hys word, ther doth he ſhew a ſufficient profe, teſtimony, &amp; ſygn of hys fre goodnes &amp; mercy to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards vs. For, thys dothe he vnto vs hauinge deſerued no ſuch thyng at hys handes. But leaſt we ſhould boaſt and crake, that we do of oure owne accorde followe hym, when he dothe call, or that we do receiue of oure owne ſwynge, hys mercye
<pb facs="tcp:177821:47"/> and grace, when he dothe offer it vnto vs, he dothe playnly affirme that we haue no eyes to ſee, nor eares to heare, but onely thoſe that he dothe make and geue vnto vs. And that he dothe bothe make and geue them vnto vs, not accordinge to our gratitude or thankefulneſſe, but accordinge to his election, and grace. And of this, haue we a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly example in Saint Luke in his boke of the Actes.<note place="margin">Actes. xiii</note> Where both the Iewes and the Gentyles did heare together the preachinge of Paule and Barnabas.

                  <p>Ye ſay the very truth. But as they be begiled and deceiued that ſaye, that our election do the hange alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and depend of the preaching of the goſpell: ſo in ſekinge the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of it, we muſt contente oure ſelues with theſe outwarde ſignes and tokens, wherby our heauenlye father is wont to certifye his chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of their election, and to bring them into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruition of it. My mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is this. Sith that it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed God oure heauenlye father, by the outward preching of his word, and by the inward working of hys holy ſpirit, (whiche is the ſeale and
<pb facs="tcp:177821:48"/> earneſt peny of oure adoption and enherytaunce) to certify vs of oure election, that is to ſay, that he hath choſen vs, for to be fellowe heyers wyth hys ſonne Ieſu Chriſt, of his heauenlye kyngdome, we oughte to contente oure ſelues wyth theſe meanes that he hath appointed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, for to come to the ſure know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and certainety of oure electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And none other meanes did he apoynte for it, but the outewarde preachinge of hys woorde and the inwarde workynge of hys holye ſpyrite, whiche teſtifyeth vnto our ſpirite that we are the chyldren of God. Let vs therefore,<note place="margin">We ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght not to ſeeke the certainly of oure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, in the hyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments of the Lord.</note> content our ſelues wyth them, and go no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For, they that wyll go about for to ſeeke the certaynetye of their election, in the hydden iudgements and incomprehenſible waies of the LORDE, muſt needes be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully tormented in theyr conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Which thinge Sathan doth ſeke aboue al other thinges. For,
<pb facs="tcp:177821:49"/> there is no nearer way for to bring men in to deſperation, than for to make them to doubte of the fauour and loue of God towards them or of theyr election vnto lyfe euerlaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge. Thus commenly is Sathan wont to whyſper in to the eares of ourconſciences: Thou myſerable man, whence canſt thou haue any ſaluation, but of the election of the Lord thy God? But who hathe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueled vnto the, or certifyed the that thou art choſen? Nowe, if we go once oute of the ryghte waye for to ſeeke for the certainely of our elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (I ſaye, that we go oute of the waye, when we go not that way to woorke, that GOD him ſelfe hathe apoynted.) It is impoſſible for vs, that euer we ſhould be dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered out of hys ſnare. And ſo muſt we needes at lengthe be broughte in to the botomeleſſe pytte of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration. Whyche is the rewarde of thoſe, that wyll contrarye to the appointment of almighty god our
<pb facs="tcp:177821:49"/> heauenlye father, ſeeke for the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintye of their election, in the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Iudgementes and in compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible waies of the Lorde, where the farther that a man doth wade, the farther ſhall he be from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing that he dothe ſeke, til y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at length he hathe throughe his vnſatiable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitye broughte hym ſelf into vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termooſte deſtruction. Whereas, if we go that waye to woorke, that God hathe appoynted, ſekinge for the certaintye of our election, wher he will haue vs to ſeeke it, we ſhal finde greate conſolation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte.</p>

                  <p>We ſhal kepe a very good order in ſeking the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainetye of oure election, if we doe

Syth that by it, as by a moſte infallible ſigne and token, the Lord our God doth certifye vs of his counſell, as muche as it is lawefull for vs to know. And leaſt we ſhuld thynke, that this callinge of God, whiche doth conſiſte in the outwarde prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge of the worde, and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde workinge of the holy ghoſt, is but a weake teſtimonye of oure election, we ought to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſyder with oure ſelues, how muche lyght and certenty it bryngeth vnto vs. Firſt and foremoſt, if we ſeeke for the mercye and fauoure of God, we muſt faſten oure eyes vpon Chriſt, in whome onely the father is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. If we longe for ſaluation, lyfe, immortalytye, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herytaunce of the kyngedome of heauen, wee muſte alſo flye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym, and to none other, ſyth that he is the onely fountayne of life, the ſhot anchore of ſaluation,
<pb facs="tcp:177821:50"/> and the ryghte heyre onlye of the kyngdome of heauen. For, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto doth our election extende, but that beyng choſen of the Lord, and receyued into the noumber of hys chyldren, we ſhoulde for the loue of hys ſonne, obtayne ſaluatyon and immortalitye? Weighe the matter wyth your ſelf as much as ye wyl, and ye ſhal fynde, vnderſtande and perceyue, that the end of it doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no farther. Therefore whome God doth take to hys chyldren, it is ſayd that he hath choſen them,<note place="margin">Ephe. i.</note> but in his annoynted, that is to ſaye, in hys ſonne Ieſu Chryſte: For, he coulde not loue them but onlye in hym, nor yet honor wyth the enhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytance of hys kyngdome, except he had made them fyrſt fellowes with hym. Now if we be choſen in hym, we ſhall not fynde in oure ſelues, the certayntye of oure electyon, nor yet in God the father, yf we beholde hym wythoute hys onlye begotten ſonne our ſauyoure Ieſu
<pb facs="tcp:177821:51"/> Chriſt. Chriſt then is the moſt ſure and infallible glaſſe or myrroure,<note place="margin">In Chriſt onely can we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde and ſee the cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tainety of oure elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> wherein we maye beholde and ſee the certainty of oure election, and that maye we do, without anye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit or fraude. For, ſith that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath determined to graffe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all in his bodye, whome he hathe from the beginninge appoynted to be hys, and doth take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al for hys children, whome he doth recogniſe or acknowledge amonge hys mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, if we be once graffed in Chriſt and haue fellowſhippe with him, then haue we a moſt euident, plain and infallible teſtimonye, that we are wrytten in the booke of lyfe. But he did mooſte certainlye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate him ſelfe vnto vs, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue vs into hys fellowſhyppe, when he did teſtifye by the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge of the Goſpell that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did geue him vnto vs. For, to be oures with all his heauenly ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe.<note place="margin">Iohn. i.</note> He, I ſaye, did teſtifye vnto vs, that as manye as did receiue
<pb facs="tcp:177821:51"/> him by faithe, they ſhoulde of hys heauenlye father be taken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued for his children. If ye do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more than to be compted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the children of GOD, and heires of his kingdome, ye climbe aboue Chriſte. Nowe, if thys be oure fartheſt marke,<note place="margin">It is a madnes to ſeeke that with oute Chriſt, that we haue alre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dye obtay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned in hym.</note> what a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe were it to ſeeke that thynge withoute hym, that we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obtained and gotten in him, and whyche canne be found in him onlye? More ouer ſithe that he is the eternal wiſdome of the father, and the verye truth it ſelf, we nead not to feare, that he dothe in hys woorde and Goſpell varye anye thynge from the wyll and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of hys heauenlye father, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we ſeeke to be certifyed of.

But this
<pb facs="tcp:177821:52"/> ought to comfort vs moſt of al, and to eſtabliſh our faith in the mercye and goodneſſe of almightye God, wherbi he hath freli choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs in his beloued, that the ſcriptures do eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wher teſtify vnto vs, that whom ſo euer Chriſt doth call into the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhippe of his churche, them he doth receiue into his protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſauegarde: and that whome ſo euer he doth receiue into his protection and ſauegarde, they are committed vnto him of his heauenlye father, for to be preſerued and kepte vnto life euerlaſting: what wil we haue any more?<note place="margin">Iohn. vi.xvii.</note> Chriſte him ſelfe cryeth out with a loude voyce and ſayeth: that as manye as the father wyll haue to be ſaued, he hath deliuered them vnto him, to kepe. Now if we wil know whether God be careful ouer our ſaluation or not, we muſt ſeke in his holy word and ſcripture whether he hath committed vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſonne Ieſu Chriſte or not, whome he hathe appoynted to bee

And if we be in doubt, whether the onlye begotten ſonne of God, hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs into his protection and ſaue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gard, he him ſelf,<note place="margin">Iohn. x.</note> wil put this dout away, ſith that he offreth him ſelfe of his owne accord to be oure ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, acknowledginge vs for hys ſheape, if we will heare his voyce. Let vs therefore embrace Chriſte, ſith that he dothe ſo gentlelye and louingly come forth, and offer hym ſelfe vnto vs. And then will he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs into his flock, and kepe vs ſafely within hys ſhepefolde.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:177821:54" rendition="simple:additions"/> theyr heartes and mindes, thoughe they be called, yet they wil geue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eares nor heede vnto the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The ſecond ſort that be called do profeſſe the Chriſtian religion, and receiue the worde,<note place="margin">Actes. viii</note> but it hathe no true roote in them. As Symon Magus, which being conuinced in his hart that the Goſpel was true, did for a time profeſſe it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it had no rote in him, he dyd ſone fall away from it. Suche are they, to whome the Lord doth geue his holy ſpirit, illuminating them for a time, but afterwards he doth forſake them, becauſe of theyr in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and vnthankfulnes, and doth ſtrike the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with greater blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The third maner of calling, is both particulare, and alſo moſte effectuall. For, by it the Lord doth only call his electe and choſen, and whome he hath ordeined before vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to life euerlaſtinge, workinge ſo in them by the inwarde operation of his holi ſpirit, that the word which
<pb facs="tcp:177821:54"/> is preached vnto them, dothe take rote in theyr hartes, and bringeth forthe frute vnto eternall lyfe. He doth alſo by the ſame ſpirit teſtifye vnto them, I meane vnto their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that they be the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, and heyres of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. But we wil come to the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it ſelf: when our ſauioure Ieſus Chriſt did ſee,<note place="margin">Mat. xxii.</note> that the goſpell was far ſpreade abrode, and that it was deſpyſed of manye, and receiued of few, he doth deſcribe God vnto vs, vnder the perſon of a mighty king, which ordaining a ſolemne feaſte, doth ſende his ſeruauntes into all coſtes, for to call a great multitude vnto it.

For, if they
<pb facs="tcp:177821:57"/> were hys ſhepe and of hys flocke, they coulde not peryſhe. Whyche thynge may be proued by hys own wordes and ſayinges, whych haue bene rehearced alredy before, and now for to make the matter more playne, maye be rehearced again: My ſhepe, ſaieth he, heare my voice and I know them,<note place="margin">Iohn. x.</note> and they folow me and I geue them life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinge, and they ſhal neuer peryſh, and no man ſhal plucke them oute of my hand.

But they that forſake the knowen truth, and turne to their olde vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myt agayne, doo neyther heare hys voyce nor yet folowe hym.

Therefore, they are none of the true ſheape. And the cauſe whye the true ſheape can not pearyſhe, nor be pluckte oute of the ſhephardes hande is onlye this: becauſe that the father which gaue them, is greater than all, and no manne is able to plucke them out of hys hande. If Sathan than were able, to bryng the true ſheepe of Chriſte into perdition, we ſhuld be fain to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that he is greater, than the heauenly father, and that he is of more power, than the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye begotten ſonne of God: I wold

<pb facs="tcp:177821:62"/> the ſede is choked in them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that we are all, touching our owne nature ſubiecte to that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and mooſte pearillous euyll, therfore, this exhortation and war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning doth by good righte pertaine vnto vs all.

Wheras on the contrarye, whome he doth ſtirre vp and appoynt to be the veſſels of his wrath, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of his ſeuerity and iuſtice, them doth he for the moſt parte de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue of the light of his word, or if he ſendeth them his worde, it is for to blind them the more, yea and for to harden them. We haue manye examples of the fyrſt: but one, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che in dede is mooſte notable, ſhall ſuffiſe vs now. By the ſpace almoſt of foure thouſand yeares, afore the comminge of Chriſte, God did hide the light of his heauenly doctrine, in a manner from all generatyons and peoples. Now if any wold ſay, that this was don, becauſe that god
<pb facs="tcp:177821:74" rendition="simple:additions"/> did iudge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnworthy of ſo great a benefite,<note place="margin">How longe the light of Goddes worde hath ben hidden al moſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the earthe.</note> we may right well aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that they, whiche came after, were as vnworthy as they, yea, and more vnworthy to, if ye will goe to their outward liuinge and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation or to their manners and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ditions. Whye did then the Lorde geue the light of his woorde rather vnto theſe, than he did vnto them before? he ſhould laboure in vaine, that would ſeke out the cauſe of ſo high a matter, whiche is hidden in the vnſearchable iudgementes and incomprehenſible waies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord. And if any man would go about by the occaſion of theſe oure ſayinges to blame the iuſtice of God, let him take this one aunſwer for all.<note place="margin">An Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that go about to blame the iuſtice of God.</note> We do affirme and ſay, that none do pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riſh vndeſeruinglye, or withoute a iuſt cauſe, and that againe, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of the mere mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God that ſome are deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſaued, whiche oughte to be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for to ſet forth and declare

                  <p>And of this we haue many examples in the ſcriptures. For, wherfore, was Moſes ſente ſo manye times vnto Pharao? was it becauſe that God had any hope, that he ſhould wyth ſo many meſſages be mollified, and wonne at lengthe? Yea rather, er the Lorde did begin, he knewe the ende of the matter, and did alſo tell
<pb facs="tcp:177821:76"/> before, what ſhoulde come to paſſe. Go thy waye, ſayeth he to Moſes,<note place="margin">Exo. iiii.</note> and ſhewe hym my mynde. And I will harden his heart that he ſhal not obey. So when he dothe raiſe vp Ezechiell,<note place="margin">Eze. ii &amp;. xii.</note> he geueth hym war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge, that he dothe ſende hym to a rebellious, and froward peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, leaſt perceiuyng that his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge did take no place, he ſhuld waxe faynte hearted.<note place="margin">Iere. i.</note> He dothe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo warne Ieremye that hys Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine ſhall be as a hote burnynge fire, wherewith the people ſhal be conſumed and deſtroyed as ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But yet the Prophecye and ſayinge of Eſaye the Prophet is playneſt of all. For,<note place="margin">Eſay. vi.</note> the LORD doothe ſend hym forth wyth theſe woordes: Goe thy waye and tell to the Chyldren of Iſrael: ye ſhal heare in deede: but ye ſhal not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande, ye ſhall plainelye ſee, and not perceiue. Harden the hart of this people, ſtoppe theyr eares, and ſhutte their eies, that they ſee
<pb facs="tcp:177821:77"/> not wyth theyr eies, nor hear with their eares, nor vnderſtande wyth their heartes, leaſt they ſhuld turne and be healed. Beholde, he ſendeth hys word vnto them, but that they maye be the more deafe, he dothe light the candel, but that they may be the blinder, he doth ſetforth his doctrine, but that they maye be the more beaſtiſh, he ſendeth vnto them a remeady, but that they ſhould not be healed with it. And therefore, Saint Ihon the Euangeliſt alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginge this prophecy,<note place="margin">Iohn. xii.</note> doth plainlye affyrme that the Iewes coulde not beleue the doctrine of Chriſte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that thys maledictyon and curſe of God did hange ouer them: Againe: this can not be denied, but that God dothe ſetforthe hys doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in parables, to thoſe, whome he will not haue to be illuminated leaſt they ſhould take any profit by it. For Chriſt oure ſauioure dothe plainly teſtify, that he dothe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expound the parables vnto his

How ſhoulde then the ſaying of the Apoſtle ſtande, if we ſhould take it, as they do?

Yea Saint Auguſtine in his bookes, of retractions, dothe playnelye declare, that he is not well pleaſed wyth hym ſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in hys bookes, whyche he wrought againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Academikes, he hadde ſo manye times vſed thys word, fortune. <hi>Poenitet me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſic me nominaſſe illic fortunam,</hi>

                  <p>I do repent, that I haue ſo named fortune there: becauſe I ſe, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue in a very euill cuſtome to ſay: this was fortunes wyl, where they ought to ſay: this was Gods wyll. But becauſe that the weakeneſſe &amp; imbecillity of men can not wel vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand or comprehend ſuch hygh miſteries: we wil vſe a certaine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, that the matter maye the better be perceiued.

For, being conſide<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red in theyr own nature, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to oure owne knowledge or iudgemente, they haue none other likelyhode. As for an example, lette vs imagine, that ſome marchaunt man beynge entred into a Foreſt,
<pb facs="tcp:177821:96"/> dothe vnwittinglye, and vnwares ſtray a way from his company, and ſo fal into the hands of theues, and be ſlaine. This mannes death was not onlye forſeene with the eie of God, but alſo apoynted by his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and euerlaſtinge decree.

                  <p>What oughte a chriſten manne to iudge in this matter then? eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the prouidence of God, hath brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght all theſe things, which of their owne nature ſeeme to be fortuite &amp; caſual, vnto their due and appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted end.

For, though we be vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, whether they ſhall chaunce
